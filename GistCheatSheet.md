## Git Cheat Sheet 
* To install git
	*  **$ sudo apt-get install git**
* Getting a git repo
	*  **$ git clone https://github.com/abc/abc..**
* Creating a repo
	*  **Make a project folder on GitHub and copy the link**
	*  **$ git init**
	*  **$ git remote add <project folder url>**
	*  **$ git add .**
* Checking a status
	*  **$ git status**
* Commiting the repo on stage
	*  **$ git commit -m "My Commit"**
* Pushing your local project folder on GitHub server 
	*  **$ git push original master**
* Logs of your previous commit (history)
	*  **$ git log**
* Removing a file from stage (tracked files)
	*  **$ git rm <file name or path>**
* To see the difference which one yet staged
	*  **$ git diff**
* To see the difference which are staged
	*  **$ git diff --staged**
* Creating a new branch
	*  **$ git branch <branch name>**
* Swithching between branches
	*  **$ git checkout <branch name>**
	*  Default branch->**"Master"**
	*  Branch is _**"movable pointer to the commits"**_

* To check on which branch we are currently working
	*  **$ git branch**
	(This will show all the branches and the active branch with a pointer **(*)**)
* To merge a branch with master
	*  **$ git merge <branch name>**
* Deleting a branch
	*  **$ git branch -d <branch name>**
* While merging _a branch with master_ it should have a direct ancestor. If not, git will doing three way merge.
	*  c0 <- c1 <- c2 <- c4
		        ^
		        |
		        c3 <- c5					
	*  Here c2 is **common**,c4 is **master** and c5 is **branch1**. And hence c2 will be **common ancestor**.
* Using **c2**(common ancestor), **c4**(master pointer) & **c5**(branch1 pointer).
	*  **Then git creates a *new snapshot* having result of above three snaps**.
	*  c0 <- c1 <- c2 <- c4 <- c6
		        ^	   |
		        |	   |
		       c3 <- c5 <--`
	*  Here c6 is **master**.
* To see the last commits on each branch
	*  **$ git branch -v**
* To see which branches are already merged you are on:
	*  **$ git branch --merge**
* To see which branches are not merged yet:
	*  **$ git branch --no-merge**
* **$ git fetch origin**
	*  Updates your _local database_ looking upon the server origin (basically the changes that you don't have yet).
* Other than merging we can use **"rebase"**
	*  **$ git rebase . master**

	*  **c0 <- c1 <- c2 <- c3**				
		       **^**		  **rebase**	     **c0 <- c1 <- c2 <- c3 <- c4`**
		       **|**		**---------->**			       **^**	
		       **c4**						       **|_c4**
	*  **$ git chechout master**
	*  **$ git merge branch1**		 	    	     **c0 <- c1 <- c2 <- c3 <- c4`**
	Here c3 is master and c4 is branch1
* Here is the another example that you can get much clarity.
	*  **c1 <- c2 <- c5 <- c6**
		       **^**
		       **|**			  **$git rebase --onto master server client**	**c1 <- c2 <- c5 <- c6 <- c8` <- c9'**
		       **c3 <- c4 <- c10**	**------------------------------------------>**	       **^**	
		       **^**									       **|**	
		       **|**									       **c3 <- c4 <- c10**
		       **c8 <- c9**
	*  Here c6 is **master**, c10 is **server** and c9 is **client**.
* **$ git chechout master**
* **$ git merge client**
		*  c1 <- c2 <- c5 <- c6 <- c8` <- c9'
		         ^
		         |
		         c3 <- c4 <- c10
		*  Now, c9` acts as **master and client** and c10 is **server**.*
* **$ git rebase master server**
		*  **c1 <- c2 <- c5 <- c6 <- c8` <- c9' <- c3` <- c4` <- c10`**
* **$ git checkout master**
* **$ git merge server**
* **$ git branch -d client server**
